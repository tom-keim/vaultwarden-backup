README | [中文文档](README_zh.md)

Docker containers for [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) (formerly known as **`bitwarden_rs`**) backup to remote.

- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ttionya/vaultwarden-backup)
- [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/ttionya/vaultwarden-backup/pkgs/container/vaultwarden-backup)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/ttionya/vaultwarden-backup)

<br>



## Rename

**Unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust, formerly known as `bitwarden_rs`, renamed to `vaultwarden`.**

For this reason, the backup tool was migrated to [ttionya/vaultwarden-backup](https://github.com/ttionya/vaultwarden-backup).

The old image can still be used, just **DEPRECATED**. It is recommended to migrate to new image [ttionya/vaultwarden-backup](https://hub.docker.com/r/ttionya/vaultwarden-backup).

**See how to migrate [here](#migration).**

<br>



## Feature

This tool supports backing up the following files or directories.

- `db.sqlite3` (for SQLite database)
- `db.dump` (for PostgreSQL database)
- `db.sql` (for MySQL / MariaDB database)
- `config.json`
- `rsa_key*` (multiple files)
- `attachments` (directory)
- `sends` (directory)

And the following ways of notifying backup results are supported.

- Ping (send on completion, start, success, or failure)
- Mail (SMTP based, send on success and on failure)
- Ntfy.sh (Configurable server address, Username/password, token and no authentication supported)

<br>



## Usage

> **Important:** We assume you already read the `vaultwarden` [documentation](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).

### Configure Rclone (⚠️ MUST READ ⚠️)

> **For backup, you need to configure Rclone first, otherwise the backup tool will not work.**
>
> **For restore, it is not necessary.**

We upload the backup files to the storage system by [Rclone](https://rclone.org/).

Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/rclone/rclone) for more storage system tutorials. Different systems get tokens differently.

#### Configure and Check

You can get the token by the following command.

```shell
docker run --rm -it \
  --mount type=volume,source=vaultwarden-rclone-data,target=/config/ \
  ttionya/vaultwarden-backup:latest \
  rclone config
```

**We recommend setting the remote name to `BitwardenBackup`, otherwise you need to specify the environment variable `RCLONE_REMOTE_NAME` as the remote name you set.**

After setting, check the configuration content by the following command.

```shell
docker run --rm -it \
  --mount type=volume,source=vaultwarden-rclone-data,target=/config/ \
  ttionya/vaultwarden-backup:latest \
  rclone config show

# Microsoft Onedrive Example
# [BitwardenBackup]
# type = onedrive
# token = {"access_token":"access token","token_type":"token type","refresh_token":"refresh token","expiry":"expiry time"}
# drive_id = driveid
# drive_type = personal
```

<br>



### Backup

#### Use Docker Compose (Recommend)

If you are a new user or are rebuilding vaultwarden, it is recommended to use the `docker-compose.yml` from the project.

Download `docker-compose.yml` to you machine, edit environment variables and start it.

You need to go to the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is saved.

```shell
# Start
docker-compose up -d

# Stop
docker-compose stop

# Restart
docker-compose restart

# Remove
docker-compose down
```

#### Automatic Backups

If you have a running vaultwarden but don't want to use `docker-compose.yml`, we also provide a backup method for you.

Make sure that your vaultwarden container is named `vaultwarden` otherwise you have to replace the container name in the `--volumes-from` section of the docker run call.

By default the data folder for vaultwarden is `/data`, you need to explicitly specify the data folder using the environment variable `DATA_DIR`.

Start the backup container with default settings. (automatic backup at 5 minute every hour)

```shell
docker run -d \
  --restart=always \
  --name vaultwarden_backup \
  --volumes-from=vaultwarden \
  --mount type=volume,source=vaultwarden-rclone-data,target=/config/ \
  -e DATA_DIR="/data" \
  ttionya/vaultwarden-backup:latest
```

<br>



### Restore

> **Important:** Restore will overwrite the existing files.

You need to stop the Docker container before the restore.

You also need to download the backup files to your local machine.

Because the host's files are not accessible in the Docker container, you need to map the directory where the backup files that need to be restored are located to the docker container.

**And go to the directory where your backup files to be restored are located.**

If you use the `docker-compose.yml` provided with this project, you can use the following command.

```shell
docker run --rm -it \
  --mount type=volume,source=vaultwarden-data,target=/bitwarden/data/ \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/bitwarden/restore/ \
  ttionya/vaultwarden-backup:latest restore \
  [OPTIONS]
```

If you are using "automatic backups", please confirm the vaultwarden volume and replace the `--mount` `source` section.

Also don't forget to use the environment variable `DATA_DIR` to specify the data directory (`-e DATA_DIR="/data"`).

```shell
docker run --rm -it \
  \ # If you are mapping the local folder to a docker container, like `vw-data`
  --mount type=bind,source="the absolution path to your local folder",target=/data/ \
  \ # If you are using docker volume
  --mount type=volume,source="docker volume name",target=/data/ \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/bitwarden/restore/ \
  -e DATA_DIR="/data" \
  ttionya/vaultwarden-backup:latest restore \
  [OPTIONS]
```

See [Options](#options) for options information.

#### Options

##### -f / --force-restore

For restore without asking for confirmation.

USE WITH CAUTION!!

<details>
<summary><strong>※ You have the compressed file named <code>backup</code></strong></summary>

##### --zip-file \<file>

You need to use this option to specify the `backup` compressed package.

Make sure the file name in the compressed package has not been changed.

##### -p / --password

THIS IS INSECURE!

If the `backup` compressed package has a password, you can use this option to set the password to extract it.

If not, the password will be asked for interactively.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>※ You have multiple independent backup files</strong></summary>

##### --db-file \<file>

You need to use this option to specify the `db.*` file.

##### --config-file \<file>

You need to use this option to specify the `config.json` file.

##### --rsakey-file \<file>

You need to use this option to specify the `rsakey.tar` file.

##### --attachments-file \<file>

You need to use this option to specify the `attachments.tar` file.

##### --sends-file \<file>

You need to use this option to specify the `sends.tar` file.

</details>

## Environment Variables

> **Note:** All environment variables have default values, you can use the docker image without setting any environment variables.

#### RCLONE_REMOTE_NAME

The name of the Rclone remote, which needs to be consistent with the remote name in the rclone config.

You can view the current remote name with the following command.

```shell
docker run --rm -it \
  --mount type=volume,source=vaultwarden-rclone-data,target=/config/ \
  ttionya/vaultwarden-backup:latest \
  rclone config show

# [BitwardenBackup] <- this
# ...
```

Default: `BitwardenBackup`

#### RCLONE_REMOTE_DIR

The folder where backup files are stored in the storage system.

Default: `/BitwardenBackup/`

#### RCLONE_GLOBAL_FLAG

Rclone global flags, see [flags](https://rclone.org/flags/).

**Do not add flags that will change the output, such as `-P`, which will affect the deletion of outdated backup files.**

Default: `''`

#### CRON

Schedule to run the backup script, based on [`supercronic`](https://github.com/aptible/supercronic). You can test the rules [here](https://crontab.guru/#5_*_*_*_*).

Default: `5 * * * *` (run the script at 5 minute every hour)

#### ZIP_ENABLE

Pack all backup files into a compressed file. When set to `'FALSE'`, each backup file will be uploaded independently.

Default: `TRUE`

#### ZIP_PASSWORD

The password for the compressed file. Note that the password will always be used when packing the backup files.

Default: `WHEREISMYPASSWORD?`

#### ZIP_TYPE

Because the `zip` format is less secure, we offer archives in `7z` format for those who seek security.

It should be noted that the password for vaultwarden is encrypted before it is sent to the server. The server does not have plaintext passwords, so the `zip` format is good enough for basic encryption needs.

Default: `zip` (only support `zip` and `7z` formats)

#### BACKUP_KEEP_DAYS

Only keep last a few days backup files in the storage system. Set to `0` to keep all backup files.

Default: `0`

#### BACKUP_FILE_SUFFIX

Each backup file is suffixed by default with `%Y%m%d`. If you back up your vault multiple times a day, that suffix is not unique anymore. This environment variable allows you to append a unique suffix to that date to create a unique backup name.

You can use any character except for `/` since it cannot be used in Linux file names.

This environment variable combines the functionalities of [`BACKUP_FILE_DATE`](#backup_file_date) and [`BACKUP_FILE_DATE_SUFFIX`](#backup_file_date_suffix), and has a higher priority. You can directly use this environment variable to control the suffix of the backup files.

Please use the [date man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html) for the format notation.

Default: `%Y%m%d`

#### TIMEZONE

Set your timezone name.

Here is timezone list at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

Default: `UTC`

#### PING_URL

Use [healthcheck.io](https://healthchecks.io/) url or similar cron monitoring to perform `GET` requests after a backup **no matter if it succeeds or fails**.

#### PING_URL_WHEN_START

Use [healthcheck.io](https://healthchecks.io/) url or similar cron monitoring to perform `GET` requests at the **beginning** of a backup.

#### PING_URL_WHEN_SUCCESS

Use [healthcheck.io](https://healthchecks.io/) url or similar cron monitoring to perform `GET` requests after a **successful** backup.

#### PING_URL_WHEN_FAILURE

Use [healthcheck.io](https://healthchecks.io/) url or similar cron monitoring to perform `GET` requests after a backup **fails**.

#### MAIL_SMTP_ENABLE

Starting from v1.19.0, we will be using [`s-nail`](https://www.sdaoden.eu/code-nail.html) instead of [`heirloom-mailx`](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-heirloom-mailx/) to send emails.

Please note that `heirloom-mailx` is a stub for `s-nail`, and most of its functionality is compatible. Therefore, you may not need to modify any environment variables for this change.

Default: `FALSE`

#### MAIL_SMTP_VARIABLES

Because the configuration for sending emails is too complicated, we allow you to configure it yourself.

**We will set the subject according to the usage scenario, so you should not use the `-s` option.**

During testing, we will add the `-v` option to display detailed information.

```text
# My example:

# For Zoho
-S smtp-use-starttls \
-S smtp=smtp://smtp.zoho.com:587 \
-S smtp-auth=login \
-S smtp-auth-user=<my-email-address> \
-S smtp-auth-password=<my-email-password> \
-S from=<my-email-address>
```

Console showing warnings? Check [issue #177](https://github.com/ttionya/vaultwarden-backup/issues/117#issuecomment-1691443179) for more details.

#### MAIL_TO

This specifies the recipient of the notification email.

#### MAIL_WHEN_SUCCESS

Sends an email when the backup is successful.

Default: `TRUE`

#### MAIL_WHEN_FAILURE

Sends an email when the backup fails.

Default: `TRUE`

#### NTFY_ENABLE

Enable ntfy.sh integration, send notification to a ntfy.sh service once a backup succeeds or fails

Default: `False`

#### NTFY_SERVER

Server address of the ntfy.sh service, including protocol. Example: `https://ntfy.sh`

Default: `''`

#### NTFY_TOPIC

Topic where notifications are send to.

**Warning: If using a public ntfy.sh service, topics may not be password-protected, so choose a name that's not easy to guess (or use password-protection)**

Default: `vaultwarden-backup`

#### NTFY_USERNAME

Username when using username + password based authentication. Leave empty if you don't want to use authentication or want to use authentication based on a token.

Default: `''`


#### NTFY_PASSWORD

Password when using username + password basedauthentication. Leave empty if you don't want to use authentication or want to use authentication based on a token.

Default: `''`

#### NTFY_TOKEN

Token when using token based authentication. Leave empty if you don't want to use authentication or want to use authentication based on an username + password.

Default: `''`

#### NTFY_PRIORITY_SUCCESS

The priority of the ntfy notification when a backup succeeds.

Default: `3`

#### NTFY_PRIORITY_FAILURE

The priority of the ntfy notification when a backup fails.

Default: `5`

#### NTFY_WHEN_SUCCESS

Send a ntfy notification when a backup succeeds. (NTFY_ENABLE must also be 'TRUE')

Default: `TRUE`

#### NTFY_WHEN_FAILURE="TRUE"

Send a ntfy notification when a backup fails. (NTFY_ENABLE must also be 'TRUE')

Default: `TRUE`

#### DATA_DIR

This folder stores the data of vaultwarden.

When using `Docker Compose`, this does not need to be changed. However, when using automatic backup, you need to change it to `/data`.

Default: `/bitwarden/data`

<details>
<summary><strong>※ Other environment variables</strong></summary>

> **You don't need to change these environment variables unless you know what you are doing.**

#### BACKUP_FILE_DATE

You should use the [`BACKUP_FILE_SUFFIX`](#backup_file_suffix) environment variable instead.

Edit this environment variable only if you explicitly want to change the time prefix of the backup file (e.g. 20220101). **Incorrect configuration may result in the backup file being overwritten by mistake.**

Same rule as [`BACKUP_FILE_DATE_SUFFIX`](#backup_file_date_suffix).

Default: `%Y%m%d`

#### BACKUP_FILE_DATE_SUFFIX

You should use the [`BACKUP_FILE_SUFFIX`](#backup_file_suffix) environment variable instead.

Each backup file is suffixed by default with `%Y%m%d`. If you back up your vault multiple times a day, that suffix is not unique anymore.
This environment variable allows you to append a unique suffix to that date (`%Y%m%d${BACKUP_FILE_DATE_SUFFIX}`) to create a unique backup name.

Note that only numbers, upper and lower case letters, `-`, `_`, `%` are supported.

Please use the [date man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html) for the format notation.

Default: `''`

#### DATA_DB

Set the path for the sqlite database file.

Default: `${DATA_DIR}/db.sqlite3`

#### DATA_RSAKEY

Set the path for the rsa_key file.

Default: `${DATA_DIR}/rsa_key`

#### DATA_ATTACHMENTS

Set the path for the attachment folder.

Default: `${DATA_DIR}/attachments`

#### DATA_SENDS

Set the path for the sends folder.

Default: `${DATA_DIR}/sends`

</details>

## Using `.env` file

If you prefer using an env file instead of environment variables, you can map the env file containing the environment variables to the `/.env` file in the container.

```shell
docker run -d \
  --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/env,target=/.env \
  ttionya/vaultwarden-backup:latest
```

<br>



## Docker Secrets

As an alternative to passing sensitive information via environment variables, `_FILE` may be appended to the previously listed environment variables. This causes the initialization script to load the values for those variables from files present in the container. In particular, this can be used to load passwords from Docker secrets stored in `/run/secrets/<secret_name>` files.

```shell
docker run -d \
  -e ZIP_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/zip-password \
  ttionya/vaultwarden-backup:latest
```

<br>



## About Priority

We will use the environment variables first, followed by the contents of the file ending in `_FILE` as defined by the environment variables. Next, we will use the contents of the file ending in `_FILE` as defined in the `.env` file, and finally the values from the `.env` file itself.

<br>



## Mail Test

You can use the following command to test mail sending. Remember to replace your SMTP variables.

```shell
docker run --rm -it -e MAIL_SMTP_VARIABLES='<your smtp variables>' ttionya/vaultwarden-backup:latest mail <mail send to>

# Or

docker run --rm -it -e MAIL_SMTP_VARIABLES='<your smtp variables>' -e MAIL_TO='<mail send to>' ttionya/vaultwarden-backup:latest mail
```

<br>



## Migration

If you use automatic backups, you just need to replace the image with `ttionya/vaultwarden-backup`. Note the name of your volume.

If you are using `docker-compose`, you need to update `bitwardenrs/server` to `vaultwarden/server` and `ttionya/bitwardenrs-backup` to `ttionya/vaultwarden-backup`.

We recommend re-downloading the `docker-compose.yml` file, replacing your environment variables, and noting the `volumes` section, which you may need to change.
